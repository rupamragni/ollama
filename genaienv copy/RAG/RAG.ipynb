Dietary Supplements and Weight Loss\\nThe number of people with excessive weight continues to rise, and ﬁghting obesity\\nhas become one of the greatest challenges of contemporary medicine. A person wishing to\\nlose weight needs to undertake several difﬁcult life-changes and practice them consistently\\n(diet, physical activity, addiction-free). Meanwhile dietary supplements are presented as\\na compelling alternative to traditional methods for combatting obesity. Wróbel-Harmas\\net al. [107] demonstrated that weight loss supplements are the most frequently sought di-\\netary supplements on the Internet, followed by preparations for muscle building and sexual\\npotency. In the US, more than 30% of people with overweight and obesity believe supple-\\nments to be an effective method for losing weight [108], while in Poland these supplements\\nare used by as many as 40–50% of young women, regardless of their weight [15].'),\n",

The average weight loss supplement\\navailable in Western markets is estimated to include 10 different ingredients [109]. The\\nmore complex the recipe, the harder it is to determine its effects on the body. The most\\npopular ingredients include chromium and chitosan, as well as green tea, Garcinia cambogia,\\nand bitter orange (Citrus aurantium) extracts [15,16]. Over the years, no studies have shown\\nthat the use of either single- or multi-ingredient preparations of those substances promotes\\nweight reduction.\\nA 2013 meta-analysis of randomized studies found that chromium supplementation\\nresulted in only 0.5 kg additional weight reduction in subjects with overweight and obesity,\\nas compared with those taking a placebo [110], and a comparable result (mean: 0.75 kg)'),\n",

Therefore, consuming fat burners,\\nespecially those purchased online, has been compared by some authors to playing a game\\nof “Russian roulette” [125]. If, despite the lack of evidence, patients wish to attempt to\\nlose weight using dietary supplements, they should never purchase these products from\\nunauthorized buyers or increase the recommended dose or use several products at the same\\ntime in the hope that it would accelerate their weight loss.
