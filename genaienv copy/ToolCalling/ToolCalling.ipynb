       "\"Page: Closed-ended question\\nSummary: A closed-ended question is any question for which a researcher provides research participants with options from which to choose a response. Closed-ended questions are sometimes phrased as a statement that requires a response.\\nA closed-ended question contrasts with an open-ended question, which cannot easily be answered with specific information.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: France\\nSummary: France, officially the French Republic, is a country located primarily in Western Europe. Its overseas regions and territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean, giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zones in the world. Metropolitan France shares borders with Belgium and Luxembourg to the north, Germany to the northeast, Switzerland to the east, Italy and Monaco to the southeast, Andorra and Spain to the south, and a maritime border with the United Kingdom to the northwest. Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea. Its eighteen integral regions—five of which are overseas—span a combined area of 632,702 km2 (244,288 sq mi) and have an estimated total population of over 68.6 million as of January 2025. France is a semi-presidential republic and its capital, largest city and main cultural and economic centre is Paris.\\nMetropolitan France was settled during the Iron Age by Celtic tribes known as Gauls before Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture. In the Early Middle Ages, the Franks formed the kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia evolving into the Kingdom of France. In the High Middle Ages, France was a powerful but decentralized feudal kingdom, but from the mid-14th to the mid-15th centuries, France was plunged into a dynastic conflict with England known as the Hundred Years' War. In the 16th century, French culture flourished during the French Renaissance and a French colonial empire emerged. Internally, France was dominated by the conflict with the House of Habsburg and the French Wars of Religion between Catholics and Huguenots. France was successful in the Thirty Years' War and further increased its influence during the reign of Louis XIV.\\nThe French Revolution of 1789 overthrew the Ancien Régime and produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating part of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured the Bourbon Restoration until the founding of the French Second Republic which was succeeded by the Second French Empire upon Napoleon III's takeover. His empire collapsed during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. This led to the establishment of the Third French Republic, and subsequent decades saw a period of economic prosperity and cultural and scientific flourishing known as the Belle Époque. France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious at great human and economic cost. It was among the Allies of World War II, but it surrendered and was occupied in 1940. Following its liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the defeat in the Algerian War. The current Fifth Republic was formed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle. Algeria and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with France.\\nFrance retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science, and philosophy.

      "Summary: A large language model (LLM) is a type of machine learning model designed for natural language processing tasks such as language generation. LLMs are language models with many parameters, and are trained with self-supervised learning on a vast amount of text.\n",
      "The largest and most capable LLMs are generative pretrained transformers (GPTs). Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.\n",

      "Summary: Vibe coding (also vibecoding) is an AI-dependent programming technique where a person describes a problem in a few sentences as a prompt to a  large language model (LLM) tuned for coding. The LLM generates software, shifting the programmer's role from manual coding to guiding, testing, and refining the AI-generated source code. Vibe coding is claimed by its advocates to allow even amateur programmers to produce software without the extensive training and skills required for software engineering. The term was introduced by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025 and listed in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary the following month as a \"slang & trending\" noun.\n",

      "Page: Retrieval-augmented generation\n",
      "Summary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that enables generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) models to retrieve and incorporate new information. It modifies interactions with a large language model (LLM) so that the model responds to user queries with reference to a specified set of documents, using this information to supplement information from its pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information.  Use cases include providing chatbot access to internal company data or generating responses based on authoritative sources.\n",
      "RAG improves large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources. According to Ars Technica, \"RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts.\" This method helps reduce AI hallucinations, which have led to real-world issues like chatbots inventing policies or lawyers citing nonexistent legal cases.\n",
      "By dynamically retrieving information, RAG enables AI to provide more accurate responses without frequent retraining. According to IBM, \"RAG also reduces the need for users to continuously train the model on new data and update its parameters as circumstances evolve. In this way, RAG can lower the computational and financial costs of running LLM-powered chatbots in an enterprise setting.\"\n",
      "Beyond efficiency gains, RAG also allows LLMs to include source references in their responses, enabling users to verify information by reviewing cited documents or original sources. This can provide greater transparency, as users can cross-check retrieved content to ensure accuracy and relevance.\n"

      "Summary::\n",
      "Advances in tissue labeling, imaging, and automated cell identification now enable the visualization of immune cell types in human tumors. However, a framework for analyzing spatial patterns within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is still lacking. To address this, we develop Spatiopath, a null-hypothesis framework that distinguishes statistically significant immune cell associations from random distributions. Using embedding functions to map cell contours and tumor regions, Spatiopath extends Ripley's K function to analyze both cell-cell and cell-tumor interactions. We validate the method with synthetic simulations and apply it to multi-color images of lung tumor sections, revealing significant spatial patterns such as mast cells accumulating near T cells and the tumor epithelium. These patterns highlight differences in spatial organization, with mast cells clustering near the epithelium and T cells positioned farther away. Spatiopath enables a better understanding of immune responses and may help identify biomarkers for patient outcomes.\n",

      "Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The treatment of lung cancer depends on the stage, type, and location of the tumor, as well as the overall health of the patient. Here's a summary of the current treatment options:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Surgery**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Lobectomy (removal of the lobe) or pneumonectomy (removal of the entire lung)\n",
      "* Wedge resection (removal of a small portion of the tumor)\n",
      "* Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for early-stage cancer\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chemotherapy**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): carboplatin, paclitaxel, etoposide, and gemcitabine\n",
      "* Small cell lung cancer (SCLC): etoposide and platinum-based chemotherapy\n",
      "\n",
      "**Targeted Therapy**\n",
      "\n",
      "* NSCLC: erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib for EGFR-positive tumors\n",
      "* SCLC: doxorubicin and topotecan for extensive disease\n",
      "\n",
      "**Immunotherapy**\n",
      "\n",
      "* NSCLC: pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab for PD-L1 positive tumors\n",
      "* SCLC: pembrolizumab and nivolumab for extensive disease\n",
      "\n",
      "**Radiation Therapy**\n",
      "\n",
      "* External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)\n",
      "* Brachytherapy: implanting radioactive material directly into the tumor\n",
      "\n",
      "**Clinical Trials**\n",
      "\n",
      "* New treatments are constantly being developed, and clinical trials offer patients the opportunity to participate in cutting-edge research.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized treatment recommendations.\n"
